# Eversnake

My coding task for this project was to essentially recreate the classic game Snake, but with a minor twist. The snake will now eat apples and has to avoid hitting rocks. This project was created as a coding challenge for Everlaw in Berkeley, CA.

## Getting Started

Below are some simple instructions to make sure you're able to run this project.

### Prerequisites

To run this, you will need to have Nodejs installed to use npm. Once you've navigated to the folder with the project, run the action below.

```
npm i
```

This will allow your computer to download all the dependencies I use throughout the project.

### Running the Program

To run the Eversnake game, you will need to run the following command

```
npm start
```

This will open a tab in your default browser with the `http://localhost:3000` as the address.

## How to Play the Game

The game is fairly simple
